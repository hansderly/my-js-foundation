### JavaScript V8 Engine

Okay, let's talk about the JavaScript engine. What is a JavaScript engine? A JavaScript engine is a program that interprets and executes JavaScript code.
The JavaScript engine take JavaScript code as input, parse it, optimize it, and then execute it. They are responsible for managing memory, handling the execution context, and interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) in the case of web browsers. As a web developer, understanding how these engines work can help you write more efficient and performant JavaScript code.

Some well-known JavaScript engines include:

-V8: Developed by Google, V8 is the engine used in the Chrome web browser. It's known for its speed and efficiency.

- SpiderMonkey: This engine is developed by the Mozilla Foundation and is used in the Firefox web browser.

- JavaScriptCore: Also known as Nitro, SquirrelFish, and Nitro, this engine is developed by Apple and used in Safari.

- Chakra: Developed by Microsoft, Chakra was used in the Edge browser (replaced by Blink in later versions of Edge) and is also used in server-side applications via Node.js.

- Rhino: An older JavaScript engine written in Java, primarily used for server-side applications.
